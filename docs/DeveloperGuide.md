### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort feature

#### Current Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by the inbuilt Collections::sort method.
This is done by passing a custom comparator that implements the Comparator interface to the sort method.
There are currently three custom comparators implemented in FAST:
- `SortByName` -- Sorts the contacts alphabetically by name.
- `SortByAppointment` -- Sorts the contacts chronologically by date.
- `SortByPriority` -- Sorts the contacts by priority tags.

`SortByName`: Implemented by using the inbuilt `String::compareTo`.  <br>
`SortByAppointment`: Implemented by first converting the appointment date from `String` to a `Date` object before using
the inbuilt `Date::compareTo` method.  <br>
`SortByPriority`: Implemented by first assigning int values to tags, tags with highest priority will have the smallest int value.
Using those priority values, the inbuilt `Integer::compareTo` is used. <br>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. <br>
Step 2. The user inputs `sort name` in the CLI to sort all contacts by name. This calls `LogicManager::execute` which in turn
calls `FastParser::parseCommand` to parse the given input. <br>
Step 3. `FastParser` will determine that it is a sort command and will call `SortCommandParser::parse`. From the given input,
`SortCommandParser` will create the corresponding `SortByName` Comparator and return a `SortCommand` with that comparator. <br>
Step 4. After execution of the user input, `LogicManager` calls `SortCommand::execute(model)` where model contains methods that mutate 
the state of our contacts. <br>
Step 5. Through a series of method chains, it calls `UniquePersonList::sortPersons(SortByName)`, which executes the sort method
to sort the list of persons by their name.<br>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How sort executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the inbuilt `Collections::sort`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May need additional attributes to compare.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a custom Sort method.
  * Pros: May not need additional attributes
  * Cons: Very complicated, may have performance issues if the sort is not efficient.

**Aspect: How SortByDate is implemented:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Convert the String value to Date object before using inbuilt `compareTo`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Need to account for empty appointment dates.

* **Alternative 2:** Compare dates in String.
    * Pros: No need to convert the values to another type.
    * Cons: Complicated since there is a need for 3 different comparisons namely, year, month, date.
    
_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Find feature

#### Current implementation

The find mechanism uses a few implementations of Predicate<Person> using the inbuilt `Predicate` class.
It uses these predicates to determine which persons to display in the search results.
There are currently 4 custom predicates implemented in FAST:
- `NameContainsQueriesPredicate` -- checks if the person's name contains the query.
- `PriorityPredicate` -- checks if the person has the given priority tag.
- `TagMatchesKeywordPredicate` -- checks if any of the person's tags match the keyword.
- `RemarkContainsKeywordPredicate` -- checks if the person's remark contains the keyword.

`NameContainsQueriesPredicate` implemented by running the name through a for-loop to see if any word starts with the query.
`PriorityPredicate` implemented by running the tags through a for-loop and checking if any of them match the given priority.
`TagMatchesKeywordPredicate` implemented by running the tags through a for-loop and checking if any of them match the given keyword.
`RemarkContainsKeywordPredicate` implemented by using the inbuilt `String::contains`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. <br>
Step 2. The user inputs `find john` in the CLI to find all contacts whose names contain `john`. This calls `LogicManager::execute` which in turn
calls `FastParser::parseCommand` to parse the given input. <br>
Step 3. `FastParser` will determine that it is a find command and will call `FindCommandParser::parse`. From the given input,
`FindCommandParser` will determine that the user is searching for a name and return a `FindCommand` with a `NameContainsQueriesPredicate`. <br>
Step 4. After execution of the user input, `LogicManager` calls `FindCommand::execute(model)` where model contains methods that mutate 
the state of our contacts. <br>
Step 5. Through a series of method chains, it calls `ModelManager::getFilteredPersonList()`, which will display the results
of the search.<br>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How find executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use many `Predicate<Person` implementations.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: For every type of find added, a new class must be made.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a custom Find method.
  * Pros: May be able to condense into 1 class
  * Cons: Very complicated and difficult to implement.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* No time/busy
* Might not be tech-savvy
* Many contacts to manage
* Has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* Needs to profile clients

**Value proposition**: Financial Advisors are busy. We will help them save time by optimising our system for them. FAST keeps track of client details and information for them.
